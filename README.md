# spotifyMusicalTimeMachine
 A program that creates a spotify list with the hits from a specific year. I used the bs4, requests and the spotipy modules, as well as the spotify and spotipy API for this project. To use it, you first have to create a spotify developer project and enter your user credentials into the project, as well as your spotify username. Everything after that works automatically. You enter a year and the program automatically creates a playlist with the top 100 songs of that year in your spotify account.

**If you want to use the program make sure to replace the environmental variables with the real credentials / username, as if you dont there will we a mistake with the spotipy API.**
